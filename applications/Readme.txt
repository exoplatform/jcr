====== Deployment procedure to an application server ======

I. Make sure you have correct: 
   * settings.xml. There should be the correct application server version :
     **  To build eXo JCR on Tomcat : Add the maven propery exo.projects.app.tomcat.version and set it to tomcat-7.x.x
     **  To build eXo JCR on JBoss : Add the maven propery exo.projects.app.jboss.version and set it to jboss-7.x.x
     **  To build eXo JCR on Jetty : Add the maven propery exo.projects.app.jetty.version and set it to jetty-8.x.x
	 
   * The bundle (tomcat-7.x.x, jboss-7.x.x or jetty-8.x.x) should be put into the directory corresponding to the value of the maven property exo.projects.directory.dependencies.
   * exo directory structure
   * Maven version 3.0.3 (or higher)

II. Has been tested with such AS:
   * Tomcat 7.0.32
   * JBoss 7.1.1
   * Jetty 8.1.8

III. Deployment
   If you want to deploy Tomcat, go to folder "exo.jcr.applications.tomcat" and run "mvn clean install -Pdeploy" command.
   If you want to deploy Jetty, go to folder "exo.jcr.applications.Jetty" and run "mvn clean install -Pdeploy" command.
   If you want to deploy JBoss, go to folder "exo.jcr.applications.jboss" and run "mvn clean install -Pdeploy" command.

IV. If you want to deploy AS with eXo JCR based on ISPN use "ispn" profile in deployment command like this "mvn clean install -Pdeploy,ispn"

V. If the command has executed successfully, go to exo-working directory, choose deployed server and run :
    In Unix environment
       * For Tomcat "bin/eXo-jbc.sh run" (or bin/eXo-ispn.sh run) command.
       * For Jetty "/eXo-jbc.sh" (or /eXo-ispn.sh) command.
       * For JBoss "bin/standalone-jbc.sh" (or bin/standalone-ispn.sh) command.
    In Windows environment
       * For Tomcat "bin/eXo-jbc.bat run" (or bin/eXo-ispn.bat run) command.
       * For Jetty "/eXo-jbc.bat" (or /eXo-ispn.bat) command.
       * For JBoss "bin/standalone-jbc.bat" (or bin/standalone-ispn.bat) command.
