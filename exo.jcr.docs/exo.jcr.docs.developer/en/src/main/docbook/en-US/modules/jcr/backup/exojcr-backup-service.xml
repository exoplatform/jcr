    <para>Restore of system workspace is not supported only as part of
    restoring of whole repository.</para>

  <section id="JCR.BackupService.Concept">
    <title>Concept</title>

    <para>The main purpose of that feature is to restore data in case of
    system faults and repository crashes. Also, the backup results may be used
    as a content history.</para>

    <para>The concept is based on the export of a workspace unit in the Full,
    or Full + Incrementals model. A repository workspace can be backup and
    restored using a combination of these modes. In all cases, at least one
    Full (initial) backup must be executed to mark a starting point of the
    backup history. An Incremental backup is not a complete image of the
    workspace. It contains only changes for some period. So it is not possible
    to perform an Incremental backup without an initial Full backup.</para>

    <para>The Backup service may operate as a hot-backup process at runtime on
    an in-use workspace. It's a case when the Full + Incrementals model should
    be used to have a guaranty of data consistency during restoration. An
    Incremental will be run starting from the start point of the Full backup
    and will contain changes that have occured during the Full backup,
    too.</para>

    <para>A <emphasis role="bold">restore</emphasis> operation is a mirror of
    a backup one. At least one Full backup should be restored to obtain a
    workspace corresponding to some points in time. On the other hand,
    Incrementals may be restored in the order of creation to reach a required
    state of a content. If the Incremental contains the same data as the Full
    backup (hot-backup), the changes will be applied again as if they were
    made in a normal way via API calls.</para>

    <para>According to the model there are several modes for backup
    logic:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Full backup only</emphasis> : Single
        operation, runs once</para>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Full + Incrementals</emphasis> : Start
        with an initial Full backup and then keep incrementals changes in one
        file. Run until it is stopped.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Full + Incrementals(periodic)</emphasis> :
        Start with an initial Full backup and then keep incrementals with
        periodic result file rotation. Run until it is stopped.</para>

  <section id="JCR.BackupService.HowItWorks">
    <title>How it works</title>

    <section id="JCR.BackupService.HowItWorks.ImplementationDetails">
      <title>Implementation details</title>

      <para>Full backup/restore is implemented using the JCR SysView
      Export/Import. Workspace data will be exported into Sysview XML data
      from root node.</para>

      <para>Restoring is implemented, using the special eXo JCR API feature: a
      dynamic workspace creation. Restoring of the workspace Full backup will
      create one new workspace in the repository. Then, the SysView XML data
      will be imported as the root node.</para>

      <para>Incremental backup is implemented using the eXo JCR ChangesLog
      API. This API allows to record each JCR API call as atomic entries in a
      changelog. Hence, the Incremental backup uses a listener that collects
      these logs and stores them in a file.</para>

      <para>Restoring an incremental backup consists in applying the collected
      set of ChangesLogs to a workspace in the correct order.</para>

      <note>
        <para>Incremental backup is an experimental feture and not supported,
        so it must be used with a lot of caution.</para>

    <section id="JCR.BackupService.HowItWorks.WorkBasics">
      <title>Work basics</title>

      <para>The work of Backup is based on the BackupConfig configuration and
      the BackupChain logical unit.</para>

      <para>BackupConfig describes the backup operation chain that will be
      performed by the service. When you intend to work with it, the
      configuration should be prepared before the backup is started.</para>

      <para>The configuration contains such values as:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Types of full and incremental
          backup</emphasis> (fullBackupType, incrementalBackupType): Strings
          with full names of classes which will cover the type
          functional.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Incremental period</emphasis>: A period
          after that a current backup will be stopped and a new one will be
          started in seconds (long).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Target repository and workspace
          names</emphasis>: Strings with described names</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Destination directory</emphasis> for
          result files: String with a path to a folder where operation result
          files will be stored.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>BackupChain is a unit performing the backup process and it covers
      the principle of initial Full backup execution and manages Incrementals
      operations. BackupChain is used as a key object for accessing current
      backups during runtime via BackupManager. Each BackupJob performs a
      single atomic operation - a Full or Incremental process. The result of
      that operation is data for a Restore. BackupChain can contain one or
      more BackupJobs. But at least the initial Full job is always there. Each
      BackupJobs has its own unique number which means its Job order in the
      chain, the initial Full job always has the number 0.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Backup process, result data and file
      location</emphasis></para>

      <para>To start the backup process, it's necessary to create the
      BackupConfig and call the BackupManager.startBackup(BackupConfig)
      method. This method will return BackupChain created according to the
      configuration. At the same time, the chain creates a BackupChainLog
      which persists BackupConfig content and BackupChain operation states to
      the file in the service working directory (see Configuration).</para>

      <para>When the chain starts the work and the initial BackupJob starts,
      the job will create a result data file using the destination directory
      path from BackupConfig. The destination directory will contain a
      directory with an automatically created name using the pattern
      repository_workspace-timestamp where timestamp is current time in the
      format of yyyyMMdd_hhmmss (E.g. db1_ws1-20080306_055404). The directory
      will contain the results of all Jobs configured for execution. Each Job
      stores the backup result in its own file with the name
      repository_workspace-timestamp.jobNumber. BackupChain saves each state
      (STARTING, WAITING, WORKING, FINISHED) of its Jobs in the
      BackupChainLog, which has a current result full file path.</para>

      <para>BackupChain log file and job result files are a whole and
      consistent unit, that is a source for a Restore.</para>

      <note>
        <para>BackupChain log contains absolute paths to job result files.
        Don't move these files to another location.</para>
      </note>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Restore requirements</emphasis></para>

      <para>As mentioned before a Restore operation is a mirror of a Backup.
      The process is a Full restore of a root node with restoring an
      additional Incremental backup to reach a desired workspace state.
      Restoring of the workspace Full backup will create a new workspace in
      the repository using given RepositoyEntry of existing repository and
      given (preconfigured) WorkspaceEntry for a new target workspace. A
      Restore process will restore a root node from the SysView XML
      data.</para>

      <note>
        <para>The target workspace should not be in the repository. Otherwise,
        a BackupConfigurationException exception will be thrown.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Finally, we may say that Restore is a process of a new Workspace
      creation and filling it with a Backup content. In case you already have
      a target Workspace (with the same name) in a Repository, you have to
      configure a new name for it. If no target workspace exists in the
      Repositor, you may use the same name as the Backup one.</para>

    <title>DB type migration</title>

    <para>You can use backup/restore mechanism to migrate between different DB
    types configuration. Currently three DB types supported (single, multi,
    isolated) and you can migrate between each of them.</para>

    <para>To accomplish migration you simply need to set desired DB type in
    the repository configuration file of backup set. It is highly recommended
    to make backup at the DB level before starting the migration process.
    <note>
        <para>After migration process, due to different DB structures, there
        can remain some unnecessary DB tables, which can be removed
        safetly.</para>
      </note></para>
      <para>Before starting migrating the data of your JCR from single/multi data format to isolated data format, you need to have the backupconsole.</para>
