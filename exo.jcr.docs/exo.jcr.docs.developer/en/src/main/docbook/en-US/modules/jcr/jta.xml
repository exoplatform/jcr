  <para>eXo JCR supports the Java Transaction API out of the box. If a
  <emphasis>TransactionService</emphasis> has been defined (refer to the
  chapter about the TransactionService for more details) at session save, it
  checks if a global transaction is active and if so, it automatically
  enrolles the JCR session in the global transaction. If you intend to use a
  managed data source, you will have to configure the service
  <emphasis>DataSourceProvider</emphasis> (for more details please refer to
  the corresponding chapter).</para>
