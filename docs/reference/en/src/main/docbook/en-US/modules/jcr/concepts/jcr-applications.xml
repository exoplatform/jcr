  <title>eXo JCR Application Model</title>

  <para>A large picture of interaction between Applications and JCR looks as
  follows:</para>

  <para>Every Content (JCR) dependent application interacts with eXo JCR via
  JSR-170 and eXo JCR API extension (mostly for administration) directly or
  using some intermediate Framework (Neither Application nor Framework should
  ever rely on Implementation directly!)</para>

  <para>We call <emphasis role="bold">Content Application</emphasis> all
  applications that may use JCR as a data storage. Some of them are generic
  and completely decoupled from JCR API as interaction protocol hides Content
  storage nature (like WebDav client), some partially decoupled (like Command
  framework based) meaning that they do not use JCR API directly, and some
  (most part) use JSR-170 directly.</para>

  <para><emphasis role="bold">Frameworks</emphasis> is a special kind of JCR
  client that acts as an intermediate level between Content Repository and End
  Client Application. There are <emphasis role="bold">Protocol</emphasis>
  (WebDav, RMI or FTP servers for example) and <emphasis
  role="bold">Pattern</emphasis> (Command, Web(servlet), J2EE connector)
  specific Frameworks. It is possible to build a multi-layered (in framework
  sense) JCR application, for example Web application uses Web framework that
  uses Command framework underneath.</para>
